          Settlements
        </h2>
        <p>
          In consideration of the Services rendered by us, you shall pay Alt-Pi a fee ("FEE"). Alt-Pi reserves the right
          to revise the Fee periodically and will intimate you of any such change within reasonable time. Alt-Pi
          reserves the right to levy additional fees on transactions undertaken through corporate cards. This additional
          fee shall at least be 1% (one percent) of transaction amount, over and above applicable credit card fees. On
          receipt of the payments in the nodal account, we will endeavour to instruct the nodal bank to transmit the
          payments payable to the seller, after deducting our Fee, from the nodal account to the seller's designated
          bank account, within 3 (three) bank working days (or such other period as may be prescribed by the Reserve
          Bank of India from time to time) from completion of transaction. Subject to any other provisions of these
          Terms of Use and completion of transaction, the seller acknowledges that we will settle the payments only upon
          actual receipt of payments in the nodal account and upon reconciliation of the payments by the Acquiring
          Banks, our payment gateway and the nodal bank. The seller will bear and be responsible and liable for the
          payment of all relevant taxes in relation to the payments made under these Terms of Use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sellers receive the amount (minus Alt-Pi's Fee) in their bank account within T+3 bank working days where T is
          defined as the date of intimation of the completion of the transaction. Alt-Pi shall be entitled to charge on
          the Fee, taxes applicable from time to time ("APPLICABLE TAXES"). It is agreed that any statutory variations
          in Applicable Taxes during the subsistence of this Agreement shall be borne by the User. Monthly invoices
          shall be raised by us in respect of the Fees charged for transactions processed during such month. Any
          reasonable dispute in respect of an amount (or a portion thereof) mentioned in an invoice must be communicated
          by the User via notice ("INVOICE DISPUTE NOTICE") within a reasonable period of time but no later than thirty
          (30) calendar days from the date of the invoice. Alt-Pi shall use good faith efforts to reconcile any
          reasonably disputed amounts within reasonable time from the receipt of the Invoice Dispute Notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          In respect of invoices received by the Client, it is agreed that if the User pays over applicable taxes under
          the Indian Income Tax laws and furnishes to us the TRACES certificate in respect of such taxes paid, then we
          shall reimburse to the User, on a quarterly basis, the amount in respect of such taxes paid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once a payment is authenticated by payment service providers, money shall be moved to the escrow account and
          the first settlement shall be initiated only after all required documents (in hard copies) are received by
          Alt-Pi.
        </p>
        <p>
          All risks associated with the delivery of the goods or service will solely be that of the seller and not of
          Alt-Pi. Also, all disputes regarding quality, merchantability, non-delivery, delay in delivery or otherwise
          will be directly between the seller and the buyer without making Alt-Pi and/ or the payment service providers,
          a party to such disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, Alt-Pi also reserves the right to close, suspend, limit or put on hold the User's access to the
          account with Alt-Pi and/ or the funds available therein, including settlements pertaining to the User under

            If the User makes incorrect or untrue disclosure of the nature of its business, resulting in a merchant
            category code violation;

            For violation of any of the applicable laws by such User.
          </li>

        <p>
          Such right to close, suspend, limit or put on hold the User's access to the account with Alt-Pi shall continue
          till such time that such User submits genuine KYC documents or credentials to the satisfaction of the relevant
          authorities as per the extant rules, regulations or guidelines with regard to KYC, as well as to the
          satisfaction of Alt-Pi without prejudice to any other legal remedy that Alt-Pi is entitled to prefer as per

          Transaction Disputes
        </h2>

        <p>
          Transactions may be disputed anytime within up to 120 (one hundred twenty) days, from the date of transaction
          by a buyer, as per the Card Payment Network Rules. Disputes resolved in favour of a buyer may result in
          reversal of payment to such buyer ("CHARGEBACK"). In the event of rejection/ suspension of payments to the
          seller, chargebacks, refunds and/or any other dispute relating to the transactions contemplated under these
          Terms of Use ("DISPUTED TRANSACTION"), on any grounds whatsoever, we will forthwith notify the seller of the
          same.
        </p>
        <p>
          On such notification the seller will conduct an internal review of such matter and will, within 5 (five)
          working days from receipt of notification, respond to us in writing either:
        </p>
        <ul>

            Transaction Refund Monies; or

            documentary evidence in support of contesting such Disputed Transaction.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All refunds shall be made to the original method of payment. In the event that the seller provides a Refund
          Request to us or fails to contest such Disputed Transaction within the aforesaid 5 (five) working days or
          contests Disputed Transaction without providing supporting documentation to us, payment service providers,
          Card Payment Network and/ or issuing institution's satisfaction, we will be entitled to recover the Refund
          Monies from credits subsequently made to the escrow account with respect to payments made by the seller's
          buyers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the event that we are unable to recover the Refund Monies as aforesaid, due to the amounts credited to the
          escrow account being lower than the Refund Monies, Alt-Pi shall be entitled to recover such Refund Monies (or
          any part thereof) from the User by (i) raising a debit note in respect of such monies; and/ or (ii)
          setting-off the remaining Refund Monies against the future payables to the seller and refund the same to the
          respective buyers. The seller will be liable to make payment of the Refund Monies or part thereof which has
          not been recovered by us forthwith. It is hereby agreed and acknowledged by the parties that the Fees charged
          by us in respect of the Disputed Transaction will not be refunded or repaid by us to the seller, buyer or any
          other person. Further, the Chargeback will be provided within 1 (one) week of the transaction and maximum
          amount of the Chargeback payable by Alt-Pi to the buyer will be the value of the transaction only.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these Terms, if the Acquirer or the Issuer charges the Chargeback
          Amount to Alt-Pi, then the Client/ You agrees and acknowledges that Alt-Pi is entitled to charge such
          Chargeback Amount to the Client/ You by way of deduction from the Transaction Amounts to be settled to the
